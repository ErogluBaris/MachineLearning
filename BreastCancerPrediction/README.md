# KNN Algorithm

In this project, I want to achieve famous KNN algorithm on breast cancer researches.

The data is coming from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
You can use this website for another machine learning algorithms as well.

# For calculating best K value
For this algorithm it is so important to get best k value (number of neighbors) in calculation. As you can see from the code
I used 11, but it can be better k values. You can try other values and see the results as well. It is also important for k value
that it should be ODD numbers.
